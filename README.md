# Password Manager

## Description
The Password Manager is a simple application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to store and manage their website login credentials, including website names, email addresses, and passwords. The program provides an option to generate secure passwords and save them for different websites.

## Features
- Save website names, email addresses, and passwords securely.
- Generate strong passwords using a combination of letters, digits, and special characters.
- Validate and ensure that all required fields are filled before saving credentials.
- Display saved credentials in an easy-to-read format.
- Provides a simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

## Usage
1. Run the program using Python (ensure you have `tkinter` and `random` libraries available).
2. Enter the website name, email address, and password for the respective fields.
3. Click the "Add" button to save the credentials.
4. Use the "Generate password" button to generate a secure password.
5. Stored credentials will be appended to a text file (`passwordmanager.txt` by default).

## Compatibility
- Developed and tested using Python 3.x.
- Utilizes `tkinter` for the graphical user interface.
- Requires the `random` module for password generation.

## Future Enhancements
- Encryption of stored passwords for improved security.
- Import and export features to save and restore credentials from files.
- Improved handling of existing credentials and duplicates.
